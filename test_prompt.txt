We  want to create the database for a company that manages a chain of stores.
The stores are identified by a unique code and are characterized by the name and type of goods sold by the store (for example clothing or furniture).
The employees of the company are identified by a serial number and their name, surname and a certified e-mail address (if available) are known. Employees can be managers, administrative staff, and stock-tacker (that is, employees whose job is to take inventories). For managers the list of certifications held is known; for administrative staff the task is known, while for  stock-tackers we know the start and end date of the contract. 
It is requested to keep track of the inventories made at each store and the stock-tacker who worked on it. For each inventory, it is known the the store where it is made, the start date, the end date, and the stock-tacker who managed the inventory. Note that each inventory is managed by only one stock-tacker, but each stock-tacker can manage multiple inventories.
For each store it is also requested to keep track of the managers who supervised the store at each time period (start date, end date). Each store can be supervised by more than one manager at the same time, and each manager can supervise multiple stores or the same store at the same time in different time periods.  It is also requested to store whether or not a manager has encountered critical issues during the supervision of a store.
