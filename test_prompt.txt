We  want to create the database for a company that manages a chain of stores.
The stores are identified by a unique code and are characterized by the name and type of goods sold by the store (for example clothing or furniture).
The employees of the company are identified by a serial number and their name, surname and a certified e-mail address (if available) are known. Employees can be managers, administrative staff, and stock-tacker (that is, employees whose job is to take inventories). For managers the list of certifications held is known; for administrative staff the task is known, while for  stock-tackers we know the start and end date of the contract. 
It is requested to keep track of the inventories made at each store and the stock-tacker who worked on it. For each inventory, it is known the the store where it is made, the start date, the end date, and the stock-tacker who managed the inventory. Note that each inventory is managed by only one stock-tacker, but each stock-tacker can manage multiple inventories.
For each store it is also requested to keep track of the managers who supervised the store at each time period (start date, end date). Each store can be supervised by more than one manager at the same time, and each manager can supervise multiple stores or the same store at the same time in different time periods.  It is also requested to store whether or not a manager has encountered critical issues during the supervision of a store.

We want to create the database for the consultation of historical books in a museum by some scholars.
To consult the books each person must register at the museum and acquire a card. Persons are identified by the 
identification code of the card; you also know the name, surname, a telephone number, an e-mail address, and the
address of the facebook page (if available). 
The books available at the museum are characterized by the ISBN, the title and the list of co-authors
of the book. For each book the list of titles of the chapters of the book is also known. If the book
is part of a series, you also know the name of the series and the number that characterizes the book
within the series. Each author is identified by a unique code and characterized by the name, surname
and any eventual pseudonym used to write.
Each consultation of a book is characterized by the person who made it, the date on which it was made,
the required book, and the state of wear of the book when withdrawn by the person for consultation.
Consider that the same book can be consulted by at most one person on each day. Consider also that
the same person can consult several different books in the same day and can consult the same book
several times but on different dates.
