# Designer-ai-1

> Our project is dedicated to the development of a module aimed at supporting students in both the creation and comprehension of **Entity-Relationship (ER) models**.
> </br>
> The primary function of this tool is to transform textual instructions outlining logical concepts into tangible ER models. By bridging the gap between textual representation and visual understanding, our module strives to provide an extended resource for students to enhance their proficiency in ER model creation and interpretation.
